##### For instructors only: Due to some _mess up_ in the files within directories and me ending up in the wrong files to update code, i had to start afresh after the afternoon in panic. However the bare minimum as advised have been done. It toggles form. And has extensive branching code in the back ground that actually take into considerations the person's background.
